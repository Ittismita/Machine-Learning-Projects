## Customer Segmentation (Practice Project)

### Goal of the project:
1. To understand if there is a relationship between different groups of customers based on information we have about them.
2. Moreover, this analysis will group all existing members and give us insights into trends, such as overall groups from different sources. This can inform the marketing team and         provide insights into where to invest more resources during marketing campaigns.

### Process:
#### Exploratory Data Analysis:
What we know about the dataset?

It’s a CSV based on 365's database, where we’ve combined information from an onboarding survey, student engagement data, and the customer lifetime value.

The dataset consists of student information of over 3,800 individuals from the 365 program. The data has been preprocessed and in addition, the volume of the dataset has been restricted and anonymised to protect the privacy of the customers.

Steps Performed during EDA:
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Data Viz and Correlation Analysis

#### Model Implementation
Implemented two clustering techniques: K-means and Hierarchical Clustering.

Opted for the results of hierarchical clustering.

Possible reasons why the results of the two algorithms might differ:
