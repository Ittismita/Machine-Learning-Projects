## Customer Segmentation (Practice Project)

### Goal of the project:
1. To understand if there is a relationship between different groups of customers based on information we have about them.
2. Moreover, this analysis will group all existing members and give us insights into trends, such as overall groups from different sources. This can inform the marketing team and         provide insights into where to invest more resources during marketing campaigns.

### Process:
#### Exploratory Data Analysis:
What we know about the dataset?

It’s a CSV based on 365's database, where we’ve combined information from an onboarding survey, student engagement data, and the customer lifetime value.

The dataset consists of student information of over 3,800 individuals from the 365 program. The data has been preprocessed and in addition, the volume of the dataset has been restricted and anonymised to protect the privacy of the customers.

4. Data Viz and Correlation Analysis

#### Model Implementation
Implemented two clustering techniques: K-means and Hierarchical Clustering.

Opted for the results of hierarchical clustering.

Possible reasons why the results of the two algorithms might differ:
Different methodologies: Hierarchical clustering builds a tree (or dendrogram) of clusters by successively splitting or merging them. The decision to split or merge can be based on various algorithms and criteria. On the other hand, k-means tries to find a predetermined number of clusters (k) that minimizes the within-cluster variance.

Initial setup sensitivity: K-means is highly sensitive to initial starting conditions—i.e., the initial placement of the centroid of each cluster. Different runs give different results. Hierarchical clustering is deterministic and will always provide the same result with the same data.

Cluster shape: K-means works best with spherical and evenly sized clusters. It might not do a good job if the clusters have irregular shapes, varying sizes, or densities. Hierarchical clustering does not have these assumptions.

#### Model Evaluation and results:
Created a summary table to analyze the algorithm's results and the resulting clustering to group the data by segments. Additionally, added the number of observations it contains and the proportion of these observations for each segment.

CLV/ Expenditure: 
1. High : >=140
2. Moderate : >=100 and <140
3. Low : <100

minutes_watched/ Engagement: 
1. High : >=1900
2. Moderate : >=1200 and <1900
3. Low : <1200

Clusters/ segments were named accordingly after analysing the summary table as:
| **Cluster**      | **No of Observations** | **Description** 														  |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Instagram Users   |289			    | discovered the channel through Instagram, are from all over the world, moderate level of engagement and expenditure         |
|World Multi-channels   |798			    | discovered the channel through a mix of Facebook, Youtube and Other platforms, are from all over the world, highest level of engagement and moderate expenditure         |
|Googlers in Europe and Anglo-Saxon   |343			    | discovered the channel through Google, are from Western Europe, US, UK, Cananda, Australia, high level of engagement and highest expenditure         |
|Friend's influence   |478			    | discovered the channel through their friends, are from all over the world, high level of engagement and moderate expenditure         |
|LinkedIn Connectors   |461			    | discovered the channel through LinkedIn, are mostly from all around the world with some from Western Europe, moderate level of engagement and expenditure         |
|Google explorers   |328			    | discovered the channel through Google, are from all over the world, moderate level of engagement and low expenditure         |
|Anglo-Saxon Mix   |1079		    | discovered the channel through Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn and Other platforms, are mostly from US,UK, Canada and Australia with some proportions from Western Europe, moderate level of engagement and high expenditure         |
|Twitter followers   |58			    | discovered the channel through Twitter, are from all around the world, lowest level of engagement and lowest expenditure         |


#### Data Interpretation
Clusters: Focusing on the smallest segment/cluster, Twitter followers, with only 58 observations. Based on the characteristics of the cluster, concluded that the efforts on Twitter bore little fruit. 
Suggestion would be to reduce spending there to a minimum. And invest little resources to upload content to the platform because the results are unsatisfactory, perhaps due to the turmoil of the platform in recent months. Marketing could become an early adopter of a new competitor platform, such as Threads.
Next, let’s examine those who frequent  Facebook. Although they’re not the most significant segment—close to 8% of all customers, with average spending in the lower half compared to the rest—the Facebook group is the most dedicated to learning. Their average watch time is over an impressive 2,700 minutes.
In terms of countries, it’s a mixed bag, with a little under a third from the US, Canada, or United Kingdom and over 60% from the rest of the world. It would be worth exploring how these students interact with the platform and why their group is more motivated to study. But this would be the focus of a different analysis on engagement.

Performance by region: Now, let’s turn to a critical aspect of marketing: performance by region. Overall, the Anglo-Saxon channel has the best performance. Customers from the USA, Canada, The UK, and Australia make up the largest customer segment from that region.  And the Google-YouTube Mix has the second largest segment, with over 900 customers from that region. The second largest area is the rest of the world.
The fewest customers are from Western Europe. Considering our initial hypothesis of exact spending for all three regions, we conclude that Western Europe’s marketing efforts are insufficient. At the same time, we observe that this segment has the highest CLV, so addressing this region and improving performance is crucial.

CLV: Let's also address the spending in various regions of the countries because this is crucial to marketing. The two highest-paying clusters are the Anglo-Saxon Multichannel and the European Multichannel. The European countries top the list of spending. When we look at the channels—through which these two segments come to the platform—we see a mix between Google, YouTube, and LinkedIn.

Based on that information, we advise marketing to focus on these acquisition channels for these regions and increase spending. This would be worthwhile because the CLV of these customers is the highest across our customer segments—meaning they are worth pursuing.

And what about the remaining regions and their channel of acquisition?

For the rest of the world, LinkedIn is the most successful channel in terms of conversion, followed by Facebook, which is why it should be the primary source for attracting customers from these regions. LinkedIn is a platform that provides excellent organic reach. Our content there is very popular; many students share their certificates and spread the word organically.
